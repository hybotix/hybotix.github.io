Welcome to my Technology Blog!

I am passionate about tinkering with  electronics and robotics! I design and build cool small to
  medium-sized robots! My current project is the Robot Smart Home Controller which is a small robot
  that can control my smart home and monitor the environment.

You will find information about all of my projects, robots, etc. here
