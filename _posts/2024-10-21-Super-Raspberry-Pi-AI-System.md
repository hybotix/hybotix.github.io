## Personal Raspberry Pi AI System
### AI For Everyone
I believe access to Artificial Intelligence (I *really* hate this term, but I am stuck with it) has to and will become less expensive and easier for everyone to access. We all should be able to have our very own Artificial Entity that runs on hardware we own, as we have for our personal computers and laptops.

The technology to make this happen exists *now*, and prices for the hardware are only going to drop each year. Even if hardware prices do not drop fast, the capabilities we will be able to buy for the same price will increase each year, just like it does with personal computers and laptops.

This is one area I am extremely interested in. I want to *show and prove* that we do not need high-priced hardware to have a Personal AI. Right now, for around $70.00, we can get an AI Kit for a Raspberry Pi 5 that allows running various models locally. I have one attached to a Pi 5 now, which gets me 13 TOPS (Trillions or Tera Operations Per Second) of AI performance. This can be doubled to 26 TOPS by replacing the Hailo 8L module on the AI Kit with the Hailo 8 (no L) module.

There is one current downside to this right now though. We can not currently use that acceleration for any purpose we want. There are restrictions, which I believe are due to lack of software support, that currently prevent using that capability in the same way we would use something like an NVIDIA Nano (the older one, no Orin) or any other NVIDIA development kit.
