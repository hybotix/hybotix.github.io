## Robot Smart Home Controller and Super Pi 5 Update and More

I have received the new PCIe Switch Hat. I am not sure how I am going to route the FPC cables from the SSD/PoE HAT and the AI KIT to the PCIe Switch HAT. It is going to be an interesting build. I have to wait until I get a PoE Switch to test this because I can not power it up from USB when the PoE HAT is connected. I am not going to risk damaging the Pi 5.

I am converting all my code for the Robot Smart Home Controller over to PlatformIO because I want a better editor. I am tired of the Arduino IDE v2. I also do not like developing in Windows and want to use Linux where things work better. I am also trying to convert code into libraries so I can manage everything easier. In the long run, this will be much better for me and code managememnt. My Arduino sketch is over 2300 lines long and takes what seems like forever to compile.

I have been selected to work on the Developers' Ecosystem Open Hardware Initiative! This is a HUGE project! I have never done anything like this before., so am going to jump in with both feet and see how big of a splash I can make. The first hardware study is going to use my Robot Smart Home Controller which is awesome! There will be a custom PCB made for this which I have wanted to do from the start. I am starting to learn KiCad so I can make schematics and PCBs. I am so excited about this!

That is all I have for now.
