## Robot Smart Home Controller sensors
### This robot will have many sensors

Here is some information on the sensors I already have testing drivers for in my Arduino sketch - they can all be turned on or off by setting #defines to True or False and recompiling the sketch. I have 16 header (*.h) files now, including one for each web page that is served.

I have a set of LEDs and 5 switches I use for testing and selecting various functions. This may transform into an easy UI for the direct operation of the robot. :wink: I have a large set of tests I will do aside from testing the various sensors. I have testing drivers for two IMUs (BNO055 9DOF and LSM6DSOX 9DOF), a light sensor, a CO2/Temperature/Humidity sensor (SCD-41), an SHT45 Temperature/Humidity sensor, a MOX Volatile Organic Compound and air quality sensor (ENS160), Light (VEML7700) in the code now. 

There will be 3 or 4 ToF distance sensors (2 front and 2 back) too at some point. :wink: I will also add one or two VL53LCX 8x8 ToF distance sensors. There will be a BME688 Temperature,/Humidity,/Pressure, and Gas sensor at some point. I am intentionally duplicating functions between sensors so I can fuse the results into final readings. I will also be adding an SGP40 Multi-Pixel Gas Sensor with a fully integrated MOX gas sensor.

I am very serious about environmental monitoring. :smile:
